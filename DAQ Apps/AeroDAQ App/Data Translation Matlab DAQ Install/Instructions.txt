How to use Data Translation with matlab

Go here and install Omni software

https://files.digilent.com/#downloads/DTSoftware/Omni-CD/

Then install matlab toolbox 
https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/60618-data-acquisition-toolbox-support-package-for-data-translation-hardware


Install legacy daq toolbox (not sure if need to do this)
https://files.digilent.com/downloads/DTSoftware/DAQAdapterMATLAB/32bitLegacy/setup.EXE


This is the Data Translation website with all the info 
https://digilent.com/reference/software/matlab/data-translation/start


The .exe to start all these installs are already in this folder



May need to revert to DT Open Layers v7.8.2 for output signal
