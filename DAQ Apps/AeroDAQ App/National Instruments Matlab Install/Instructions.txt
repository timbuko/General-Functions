You can check that the DAQ you want is connected by going to NI Max app and can check that devices are listed 
My System>Devices and Interfaces>NI PXIe-4331 "PXISlotX" 
or

if you click the down arrow "v" on the device you want, all the ports show up and if you right
 click you can test the device and see the signal it is outputting
